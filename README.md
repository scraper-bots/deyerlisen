# 📱📊 Mobile Investment App Data Extraction via Traffic Interception

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline to extract financial and company data from a mobile investment application by intercepting mobile network traffic using `mitmproxy`. It is designed for experienced data analysts and scraping professionals who need access to structured data when no public API or web interface is available.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Many financial and investment apps contain high-value data — including company profiles, analyst ratings, stock fundamentals, and ETF holdings — but do not offer official APIs or accessible web interfaces. This project outlines how to:

- Intercept mobile app traffic
- Identify and reverse-engineer hidden API endpoints
- Extract data in structured format (JSON/CSV)
- Reuse and automate API calls using Python

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install mitmproxy

Install on your desktop or laptop:

```bash
# macOS
brew install mitmproxy

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mitmproxy

# Windows
Download installer from https://mitmproxy.org/
```

---

### Step 2: Configure mitmproxy

Start mitmproxy in terminal:

```bash
mitmproxy
```

By default, this runs a proxy at `localhost:8080`.

---

### Step 3: Configure Your Mobile Device

#### 🔗 Set Proxy:

* Connect your mobile device to the **same Wi-Fi network**
* Navigate to:
  `Settings > Wi-Fi > [Your Network] > Proxy > Manual`
* Set proxy:

  * **Host**: Your computer’s local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.10`)
  * **Port**: `8080`

#### 🔐 Trust the mitmproxy Certificate:

1. On your phone, open the browser and go to:

   ```
   http://mitm.it
   ```
2. Download and install the certificate for your OS
3. Trust it manually:

   * **Android**:
     `Settings > Security > Encryption & Credentials > Install CA Certificate`
   * **iOS**:
     `Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings > Enable Full Trust`

---

### Step 4: Open the Investment App

* Launch the mobile investment app (e.g., Robinhood, eToro, Fintel, etc.)
* mitmproxy will display real-time requests from the app

---

### Step 5: Identify Useful API Requests

Look for:

* URLs like `/api/stocks`, `/companies/`, `/search`
* Response types: `application/json`
* Headers such as `Authorization`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`

Use mitmproxy filters:

```bash
~u api          # URLs containing 'api'
~m GET          # Only GET requests
~s 200          # Status 200 OK
```

---

### Step 6: Reconstruct API Request in Python

Example script:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_EXTRACTED_TOKEN",
    "User-Agent": "AppName/1.0.0 (Android 11)",
    # Additional headers may be required
}

url = "https://api.appname.com/v1/companies?page=1"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

# Export to CSV
pd.DataFrame(data['results']).to_csv("data/companies.csv", index=False)
```

---

### Step 7: Automate API Pagination

```python
all_data = []

for page in range(1, 20):
    url = f"https://api.appname.com/v1/companies?page={page}"
    r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if r.status_code != 200:
        break
    all_data.extend(r.json().get('results', []))

pd.DataFrame(all_data).to_csv("data/companies.csv", index=False)
```

## 🧠 Advanced: Bypassing SSL Pinning

Some apps implement **SSL pinning**, which blocks proxy certificates.

To bypass:

1. Use **rooted Android emulator** or **Frida**
2. Run:

   ```bash
   frida -U -n com.app.name -l bypass-ssl.js
   ```
3. Or patch the app via APK static modification

> Contact me for sample `Frida` scripts or Magisk modules if needed.

## 📁 Sample Output

| company\_name | ticker | sector     | rating | market\_cap |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Apple Inc.    | AAPL   | Technology | Buy    | 3.1T        |
| Tesla Inc.    | TSLA   | Auto       | Hold   | 900B        |

---

## 📌 Best Practices

* Mimic exact headers (User-Agent, Auth, Accept-Language)
* Rotate IPs/user-agents if scraping at scale
* Sleep between requests to avoid rate limiting
* Never hardcode tokens in public code
